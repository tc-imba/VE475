# Ex.3 Readme File

## Compilation

This program is built and tested under Linux (Ubuntu 17.04), with cmake > 3.5, and the GMP Library is used. It can be installed by
```
$ apt-get install libgmp-dev
```

The CMakeLists file will find `libgmp.so` and `libgmpxx.so` under `/usr/lib` if you've installed it correctly.

## Running
After running the program, two random integers of 4096 bits will be generated by a random number function in the GMP Library. Then the `gcd` function in the GMP Library will be called to get the greatest common divisor of them, and my `extended_euclidean_algorithm` function will be called and compared with the result above. Actually they are always the same.

## Function Documentation

### extended_euclidean_algorithm

```
std::pair<mpz_class, std::pair<mpz_class, mpz_class> > extended_euclidean_algorithm(const mpz_class &a, const mpz_class &b)
```

This function implements the extended Euclidean algorithm.
The parameters are two integers to be evaluated.
The return value is a `std::pair` of an integer and another `std::pair`.
The integer is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The other `std::pair` is two BÃ©zout coefficients (integer).
