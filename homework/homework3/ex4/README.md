## Compilation

This program is written in c, built and tested under Linux (Ubuntu 17.04), with cmake > 3.5

You can generate the Makefile by
```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
$ cmake ./
```
You need to generate it yourself due to some cross-platform issues. (You can also use the Makefile in this directory, but perhaps it won't work)

## Description

This is a complete implementation of AES (both encryption and decryption). There are two functions exported to be used:

```
uint8_t *aes_encode(const uint8_t text[0x10], const uint8_t key[0x10]);
uint8_t *aes_decode(const uint8_t text[0x10], const uint8_t key[0x10]);
```

You may find some information about the functions in the header file (`aes.h`).

The S-box and invert S-box in `aes.h` is generated by the program in `sbox.c`, with some format process.

Note that this is only a naive implementation of plaintext with exactly 128 bits, in a unsigned char pointer of size 16. In the main file, a simple test is applied: (all of the data is in hex)

The plaintext is `0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210`

The key is `0f470caf15d9b77f71e8ad67c959d698`

The ciphertext is `53c4bd0eb56b174f1d6b97c7424df219`

The decrypted text is `0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210` (the same as plaintext)
